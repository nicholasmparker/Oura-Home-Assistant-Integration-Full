## 🎉 Oura Ring v2 Integration v2.0.0 - Production Ready!

This is a **major milestone release** marking the integration as **production-ready** with critical bug fixes, enhanced reliability, and comprehensive testing!

## 🐛 CRITICAL BUG FIXES IN v2.0.0

### OAuth Token Access Fix
- **Fixed**: OAuth token was being accessed incorrectly, causing `None` token errors
- **Root Cause**: `async_ensure_token_valid()` validates/refreshes but doesn't return the token
- **Solution**: Now properly accesses token via `session.token` property after validation
- **Impact**: Eliminates authentication failures and API call errors

### Entity Category Validation Fix
- **Fixed**: Entity category validation errors preventing sensor creation
- **Root Cause**: Using string `"diagnostic"` instead of `EntityCategory.DIAGNOSTIC` enum
- **Solution**: Imported `EntityCategory` from `homeassistant.helpers.entity` and converted all strings to enums
- **Impact**: All diagnostic sensors now properly categorized and functional

### Coordinator Entry Attribute Fix
- **Fixed**: `AttributeError: 'OuraDataUpdateCoordinator' object has no attribute 'entry'`
- **Root Cause**: Coordinator wasn't storing the ConfigEntry reference needed for unique IDs
- **Solution**: Added `entry: ConfigEntry` parameter to coordinator and stored as instance attribute
- **Impact**: Fixes sensor initialization and multi-account support

## ✨ ENHANCEMENTS IN v2.0.0

### Enum Device Class Support
- **Resilience Level** sensor now has proper enum device class
- **Valid Options**: limited, adequate, solid, strong, exceptional
- **User Experience**: Users can see all possible resilience levels in the UI

### Enhanced Debugging
- Added debug logging for OAuth session state to aid troubleshooting
- Authentication success messages in config flow
- Better error context for API failures

### Documentation Improvements
- **README Updates**: Added ⚠️ warnings for 10 sensors commonly unavailable for new users
- **Sensor Availability**: Clear documentation explaining why certain sensors may be unavailable initially
- **New User Guidance**: Detailed explanation of baseline data collection requirements
- **Corrected Defaults**: Fixed historical data default from 30 to 14 days to match actual code

## 🧪 TESTING & VALIDATION

### Comprehensive Test Suite

- Docker-based testing with Home Assistant 2025.11
- Tests cover coordinator, sensors, statistics, entity categories, and integration setup
- Validates all bug fixes and enhancements

### Real-World Deployment
- Tested with actual Home Assistant 2025.11 installation
- Verified OAuth flow works correctly
- Confirmed all 43 sensors populate properly
- Validated historical data loading and statistics integration

## 📊 COMPLETE FEATURE SET

All features from v1.2.0 remain available:

- **Historical data loading** with 14-day default (configurable 1-90 days)
- **Long-term statistics** integration for all sensors
- **Home Assistant 2025.11 compliance** with modern entity naming and device grouping
- **OAuth2 authentication** with proper scope handling
- **HACS compatible** for easy installation

## ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES & UPGRADE NOTES

### 🔴 BREAKING CHANGE: Entity ID Naming Convention

Due to Home Assistant 2025.11 modernization, **all entity IDs have changed**:

**Old format (v1.x.x):**
```
sensor.oura_sleep_score
sensor.oura_readiness_score
sensor.oura_resilience_level
```

**New format (v2.0.0):**
```
sensor.oura_ring_sleep_score
sensor.oura_ring_readiness_score
sensor.oura_ring_resilience_level
```

### 📋 Migration Path to Preserve Historical Data

**Option 1: Rename Device to Keep Old Entity IDs (Recommended)**

This method preserves ALL historical data by keeping your old entity IDs:

1. **Upgrade** to v2.0.0 via HACS
2. **Restart** Home Assistant
3. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Oura Ring**
4. Click on the **Oura Ring** device
5. Click the **⚙️ (gear icon)** at the top right
6. **Rename** the device from "Oura Ring" to **"Oura"**
7. Click the **☰ (burger menu)** at the top right
8. Select **"Rename entities"**
9. This will rename all entities back to the old format (`sensor.oura_*`)
10. ✅ **All your historical data is preserved!**

**Optional:** If you want custom entity names:
- Rename the device again to anything you like (e.g., "Louis' Oura")
- Use "Rename entities" again to update to your preferred naming scheme

**Option 2: Manual Entity Rename (For Custom Names)**

If you want to keep the new `sensor.oura_ring_*` format but preserve history:

1. **Before upgrading**, note down your entity IDs
2. **Upgrade** to v2.0.0 via HACS and restart
3. For each entity, go to **Settings** → **Entities** → search for the entity
4. Click the entity, then click the **⚙️ (gear icon)**
5. Change the **Entity ID** to match your old one
6. Historical data will be preserved for renamed entities

**Option 3: Update All References (No Data Preservation)**

If historical data preservation isn't critical:

1. **Upgrade** to v2.0.0 via HACS
2. **Find & Replace**: Use `sensor.oura_` → `sensor.oura_ring_` in:
   - Automations
   - Scripts
   - Dashboards/Lovelace cards
   - Templates
3. New data will start recording under new entity IDs

### ✅ What Still Works

- **No re-authorization required** - existing OAuth tokens will continue working
- **Historical data preserved** - long-term statistics remain intact
- **Automatic bug fixes** - all bug fixes apply immediately upon upgrade

### 🆕 For New Installations
- Follow standard installation process via HACS
- Entity IDs will use the new `sensor.oura_ring_*` format from the start
- Some sensors may be unavailable initially (see documentation)
- Historical data will load automatically on first setup

## 📈 STABILITY IMPROVEMENTS

- **Production Ready**: All critical bugs resolved
- **Enhanced Reliability**: Proper error handling and validation
- **Better User Experience**: Clear documentation and helpful error messages
- **Tested at Scale**: Validated with comprehensive automated test suite

## 🙏 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
