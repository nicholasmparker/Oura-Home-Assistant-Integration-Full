**Total: 46 sensors**

**Important Notes**:
- Sensors marked with ⚠️ may be **unavailable** for new Oura Ring users (typically the first few weeks of usage). The Oura API does not provide data for these sensors until sufficient baseline data has been collected. This is normal behavior and they may become available over time as you continue using your ring.
- Some sensors marked with feature requirements may return 401 Unauthorized errors if your Oura account/ring doesn't have access to those features.
- The integration will continue to work with all available sensors - unavailable sensors simply won't display values until Oura provides data for them.

## Installation

### HACS Installation (Recommended)

**Oura Ring is now available in the HACS default repository!**

1. Open HACS in your Home Assistant instance
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Search for "Oura Ring"
4. Click "Download"
5. Restart Home Assistant

### Add Integration to Home Assistant

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and start the Oura Ring integration setup.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/config_flow_start.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/config_flow_start/?domain=oura)

**Click the button above** to add the Oura Ring integration to your Home Assistant instance.

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/oura` directory to your `config/custom_components/` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

### Step 1: Create Oura Application

1. Go to [Oura Cloud](https://developer.ouraring.com/applications)
2. Sign in with your Oura account
3. Click "Create a New Application"
4. Fill in the application details:
   - **Application Name**: Home Assistant
   - **Application Website**: Your Home Assistant URL
   - **Redirect URI**: `https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/oauth`
5. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Step 2: Configure Application Credentials in Home Assistant

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click on **Application Credentials** (in the top menu)
3. Click **Add Application Credential**
4. **Note**: You may see either a dropdown to select "Oura Ring" OR a generic form - both work!
5. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret** from Step 1
6. Click **Create**

**Important**: Application Credentials is just for storing OAuth credentials. You won't see Oura Ring listed as an active integration here.

### Step 3: Add Oura Ring Integration

**Now** you can add the actual integration:

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **Add Integration**
3. Search for "Oura Ring" - **you should see it here!**
4. Click on it and follow the OAuth2 authentication flow
5. You'll be redirected to Oura's website to authorize the integration
6. After authorization, you'll be redirected back to Home Assistant
7. The integration will be configured and sensors will start appearing

## Usage

Once configured, sensors will appear under the Oura Ring integration. You can use these sensors in:

- **Dashboards**: Display your sleep, readiness, and activity data with beautiful charts
- **Automations**: Trigger actions based on your Oura Ring data
- **Scripts**: Use sensor values in your scripts
- **Templates**: Create custom sensors based on Oura data

For dashboard examples using ApexCharts, see the [Dashboard Examples](#dashboard-examples) section below.

### Example Automation

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Low Sleep Alert"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.oura_sleep_score
        below: 70
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Your sleep score is low. Consider resting today."
```

## Data Update Frequency

The integration polls the Oura API with a configurable update interval (default: 5 minutes). You can configure this interval:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Find "Oura Ring" and click **CONFIGURE**
3. Set your desired update interval (1-60 minutes)
4. Set historical data months (1-48 months, default: 3 months) - **only loaded on first setup**
5. Click **SUBMIT**

The integration will automatically reload with the new interval. The default 5-minute interval is optimized to:
- Provide timely updates
- Minimize API calls
- Respect Oura's rate limits

### Historical Data Loading

On **first setup**, the integration automatically fetches historical data (default: 3 months) to populate your dashboards immediately. This means:

✅ **Instant dashboard population** - Your charts show data from day one  
✅ **No waiting period** - See trends and patterns immediately  
✅ **One-time fetch** - Historical data is only loaded once during initial setup  
✅ **Configurable** - Choose 1-48 months of history based on your needs (up to 4 years)  

After the initial historical load, the integration fetches only new data during regular updates (every 5 minutes by default), keeping API usage minimal.

#### How It Works

The integration uses Home Assistant's **Long-Term Statistics** system to store historical data:

1. **Initial Setup**: When you first add the integration, it fetches 3 months (or your configured amount) of historical data
2. **Statistics Import**: All historical data points are imported as long-term statistics with proper timestamps
3. **Database Storage**: Data is stored in Home Assistant's statistics database (separate from state history)
4. **Immediate Availability**: All history graphs, ApexCharts, and Energy dashboard cards can access this data immediately
5. **Daily Updates**: Ongoing updates only fetch new data (typically 1 day), which is much more efficient

**Benefits of Long-Term Statistics**:
- 📊 Works with all history visualization cards (ApexCharts, History Graph, Statistics Graph)
- 💾 Efficient database storage (optimized for long-term data)
- 🔄 Properly timestamped (each data point has the correct historical date)
- ⚡ Fast queries (statistics database is optimized for time-series data)
- 🎯 No fake "state changes" - clean, accurate historical data

## Dashboard Examples

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication issues:

1. Verify your Client ID and Client Secret are correct
2. Ensure the Redirect URI matches exactly in both Oura Cloud and Home Assistant
3. Check Home Assistant logs for specific error messages
4. Try removing and re-adding the integration

### Missing Sensors

If some sensors are not appearing:

1. Ensure your Oura Ring is synced with the Oura app
2. Check that you have recent data in the Oura app
3. Wait for the next update cycle (default: 5 minutes)
4. Check Home Assistant logs for errors

### Unavailable Sensors

Some sensors may show as "unavailable" when Oura doesn't have sufficient data or hasn't established baseline measurements:

**Common for all users (temporary unavailability):**
- **Resting Heart Rate Score**: Requires sufficient heart rate measurements during rest periods
- **HRV Balance Score**: Requires sufficient HRV data collection (usually from sleep)

**Common for new ring users (may take weeks to become available):**
- **Cardiovascular Age**: Requires extended baseline data collection
- **VO2 Max**: Requires sufficient activity and cardiovascular data
- **Stress/Recovery Metrics**: Stress High Duration, Recovery High Duration, Stress Day Summary
- **Resilience Scores**: Sleep Recovery Score, Daytime Recovery Score, Stress Resilience Score
- **Sleep Optimization**: Optimal Bedtime Start, Optimal Bedtime End

This is normal behavior, especially:
- **In the first few weeks of wearing your ring** - Most advanced metrics require baseline establishment
- After periods of not wearing the ring
- If you haven't had sufficient sleep for HRV measurements
- During data processing delays

These sensors will automatically become available once Oura collects and processes the necessary baseline data. The Oura API simply does not provide values for these sensors until sufficient data history exists.

### API Rate Limiting

If you see rate limiting errors:

- The integration is designed to respect Oura's API limits
- Avoid manually triggering updates too frequently
- Check if you have other integrations also accessing the Oura API

## Development

This integration is built using modern Home Assistant patterns:

- **OAuth2 Flow**: Uses Home Assistant's built-in OAuth2 implementation
- **DataUpdateCoordinator**: Efficient data fetching with 12 specialized processing methods
- **Configuration-Driven Design**: Maintainable, declarative structures throughout
- **Modern Entity Standards**: `has_entity_name=True`, translation keys, entity categories
- **Entry-Scoped IDs**: Multi-account support with proper unique ID scoping
- **Type Hints**: Full type hint coverage for better code quality
- **Async**: All operations are asynchronous
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and clean logging
- **Test Coverage**: 39 automated tests with comprehensive fixtures
- **Code Efficiency**: 51.5% code reduction in statistics module through refactoring
